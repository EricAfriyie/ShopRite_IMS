An attractive splash screen welcomes 
users to the application before directing
them to the login form.

If the userName, password, and role 
match the Seller table entries, the 
user will login to the Selling Form. 
The login form is connected to a MySQL 
database. There are two roles in the 
application: Admin and Seller/Attendant.


He can sell various items and produce 
invoices from the selling form.
The Product form is accessible to 
those who log in as Admin. 
He has the ability to view, edit, 
delete and add products.



The Admin has the ability to add, 
amend, or update the various Sellers.
The Admin can list all the sales for a 
given day and manage the various 
Categories that are associated with 
various goods.


At the selling page, the administrator
 or attendant can order the products 
by categories. Before sales are rendered, 
the pricing and stock levels of the 
available products are shown on the 
screen.
